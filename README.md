Day 5 Part A:
    Input will have two parts:
        1 -     a series of "(X|Y)" pairs
        2 -     a series of a list of numbers
    
    Input part 1 indicates the value 'X' should always come before value 'Y' when looking at input part 2.
    Look at the second part of input and find all VALID lines (ie ones in which the numbers are in the correct order according to rules of first part of input).
    For EACH of the VALID lines, find the SUM of the MIDDLE numbers. This is the part A answer.
